## Prerequisites

-Arduino IDE.

-Arduino components configured as shown in the demo video.

## Getting Started

-Setup an Arduino Uno circuit as shown in the demo video;

-Open Arduino IDE, go to "Tools", and select your Arduino board (in this case a Uno board was used);

-With the circuit connected to the computer running the IDE, select "Send" to initialize the circuit;

-Press any of the two buttons on the circuit to simulate pedestrians requesting to cross the crosswalk, and observe as the LED's representing traffic lights behave.
